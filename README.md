## 🧠 **About Me**  

I'm a passionate **Backend Developer** with a strong focus on logical problem-solving and efficient system design. My journey began with a curiosity for turning complex challenges into elegant solutions, and now I craft robust backend architectures with Laravel.  

✨ **Philosophy**:  
- **"Do it yourself because no one will do it for you."**  
- **"If it works, optimize it—if it’s perfect, it’s probably outdated."**
